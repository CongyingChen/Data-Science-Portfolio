# My  Portfolio of Course W201 Research Design and Applications for Data and Analysis

This project lists ideas that initially brought me to data science track and studying Master of Information and Data Science at UC Berkeley. This research design course give me the opportunity to refine my ideals, give a voice to those thoughts and to share them with others. Please refer to the link for details: https://w201rdada.github.io/portfolio-CongyingChen/index.html

One of my ideals (*Guest Experience Personalizer*) is selected in the class as a group project. Please refer to the [slides presentation](https://github.com/CongyingChen/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Research_Design/Guest_Experience_Personalizer(GEP).pdf), [paper](https://github.com/CongyingChen/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Research_Design/Guest_Experience_Personalizer(GEP)_Paper.pdf), and [demo video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MbKdP3_y5XJoYJTzlzqDrDNnq7ZsLHc4/view?usp=sharing) for details.
