# Charlene's Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my data science portfolio! It includes all the data science related projects that I have done with team members, techniques including machine learning, NLP, data visualization, and experiment and causal inference. 

As former revenue manager and data analyst with newly acquired data science skills and strong business insights in the hospitality industry, I?m currently pursuing a new adventure as a Data Scientist, with strong curiosity about data, a passion for the hospitality business, and the ability to learn and adopt new tools quickly.
