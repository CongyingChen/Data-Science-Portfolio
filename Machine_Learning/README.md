# Forecasting Outcomes of 2018 Women’s March Madness
## Julia Buffinton, Charlene Chen, Arvindh Ganesan,  Prashant Kumar Sahay

In this project, we use historical data about NCAA Division I women's college basketball games (both tournament and regular season) and teams, with the goal of predicting the winning probabilities for every possible matchup of teams of the 2018 NCAA "March Madness" tournament.  

We were able to achieve a log-loss of 0.43159 on 2018 NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Tournament game matchups using an ‘ensemble’ model reflecting regular season performance and tournament-level information for each team in the matchup. 

There appears to be room for improvement, although we recognize that there may be a ceiling in performance of our models on tournament outcomes. Especially since we perform reasonably competitively against other teams in the Kaggle competition (and we certainly are not experts, yet!), we hypothesize that we may be quickly approaching this performance ceiling. 

Our final predictions were not submitted to Kaggle, as we finalized this model after the competition had completed. However, we are encouraged by our performance and plan to test this model in future years as well. We look forward to predicting the 2019 NCAA Division I Women’s Basketball Tournament.
