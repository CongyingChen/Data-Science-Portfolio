## Julia Buffinton, Charlene Chen, Arvindh Ganesan,  Prashant Kumar Sahay

In this project, we use historical data about NCAA Division I women's college basketball games (both tournament and regular season) and teams, with the goal of predicting the winning probabilities for every possible matchup of teams of the 2018 NCAA "March Madness" tournament.  

We were able to achieve a log-loss of 0.43159 on 2018 NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Tournament game matchups using an ‘ensemble’ model reflecting regular season performance and tournament-level information for each team in the matchup.
